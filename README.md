# TicTacToe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game I make in Java to explore the horror that is swing

This was a start to learning to what extent I could use swing for a game renderer/window/input manager, which of cource is a bad 
idea if you've every used swing. It was also an attempt to create a project that conforms to the MVC paradigm, which is quite 
un-needed for somthing like this (far more suited to web dev), but I did manage to create this little thing (which was also the 
only project in this vain that I finished). Its a simple tick tack toe game, not much else to say.
